Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


A fork is a clone that exists only on git hub, it tracks how projects split up, a clone is a copy of a repository, a branch is a chain of commits that has been named. You would use a fork to take some one elses code, you would use clone to down load this, and you would use branches for your differnt versions of your project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This help with fast forward merges?

How would you collaborate without using Git or Github? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You could use drop box, or send via email. You would not have to learn git, but it could get really messy and be hard to merge things.
