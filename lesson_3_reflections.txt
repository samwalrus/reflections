Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


A fork is a clone that exists only on git hub, it tracks how projects split up, a clone is a copy of a repository, a branch is a chain of commits that has been named. You would use a fork to take some one elses code, you would use clone to down load this, and you would use branches for your differnt versions of your project
